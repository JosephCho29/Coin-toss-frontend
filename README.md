# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

THINGS TO DO
- Take off play online games 
- 'The best place to place bets between just you and your friends'
- Not sure about the pay option icons at the bottom of the landing page as we are not expecting forms of payment. 
- Freinds do not display on the home page, but they do show up on the user profile 
- Resizing of some of the CSS so we do not have to zoom in and out - Bets - Friends - Created Bets on Profile Page 
- Mobile version !!!!
- Need to set up our README - websits used, screen shots of our app, etc....
- Claim tokens still need to be worked out, not all tokens went to the winner. Reconizes that there is a winner. 
- split the winning coniditon sting - 3 sections dynamically - left middle right - regenerating 
- see what does change on each page - regeneration 
- take back to user profile after winning the bet

"string" vs "string" - string.split(" ") - bet title split
